For my teammates.
You must do the following to run this web application:

1. Open terminal
2. copy/paste: ``pip install mysql-connector`` or ``pip install mysql-connector`` for windows (I am using mac so I can not confirm this).
3. have python3 installed
4. Review all imports and make sure they are installed on your computer
